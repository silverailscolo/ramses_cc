"""RAMSES CC - Passive device scan integration.

Wraps the ramses_rf DiscoveryScan engine with HA-specific concerns:
- status/enabled/owner/faked metadata (stored in HA .storage/)
- persistent notifications for new/lost devices
- service calls for accept/discard/remove/enable/disable
- schema auto-generation from accepted devices
- periodic checkpoint to .storage/

The scan engine itself (ramses_rf.discovery_scan) is read-only and
HA-agnostic. This module adds the user-facing layer.
